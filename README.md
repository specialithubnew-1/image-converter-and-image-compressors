### Why people keep coming back to this tool

I built this because every other "free online image compressor" either:
- forces you to upload files to their server (privacy nightmare)
- adds watermarks or crops images randomly
- makes you wait forever or watch ads that cover the screen
- loses way too much quality even at "high" settings

This one is different:
- Everything happens **inside your browser** using Canvas API
- Your photos **never leave your device**
- You see side-by-side preview + exact KB saved & percentage reduction
- Works offline after first load
- Super lightweight — loads in < 1 second even on slow connections

### Main features right now

- Drag & drop or click to select JPG / PNG / WebP
- Quality slider (10–95%) — lower = smaller file
- Optional max width resize (keeps aspect ratio)
- Output as JPEG or WebP (WebP usually 30–50% smaller for same visual quality)
- Before / after comparison
- One-click download of optimized image
- Shows original size vs new size + % saved

### Real examples I tested myself

- 5.1 MB vacation photo (6000×4000 px)  
  → Quality 70%, max width 1920 px, output WebP  
  → New size 612 KB → **88% smaller** — still looks sharp on phone

- 2.3 MB screenshot (2560×1440)  
  → Quality 65%, WebP  
  → 278 KB → **88% reduction** — perfect for sharing in WhatsApp groups

- 1.4 MB product photo for Instagram  
  → Quality 80%, JPEG  
  → 420 KB → **70% smaller** — uploads faster, looks the same

### How to use it

1. Click the image above or visit the live demo  
2. Drag your photo in or click "Drop Image Here"  
3. Slide quality & set max width if needed  
4. Choose JPEG or WebP output  
5. Click "Optimize Now"  
6. Compare before/after → download the smaller version

### Limitations (being honest)

- Works best under ~20–30 MB (browser memory limit)  
- No batch/multiple files yet (coming soon maybe)  
- PNG output not added (usually makes files bigger anyway)  
- Very large images (8000+ px) can lag on old phones  
- No EXIF data preserved (most people don’t need it)

### Tech stack (if you're a developer)

- Pure HTML + CSS + Vanilla JavaScript  
- Uses native `<canvas>` + `toBlob()` for compression  
- No external libraries except Font Awesome CDN for icons  
- ~30 KB gzipped — loads fast everywhere

### Want to help or fork it?

Repo is open source — feel free to:
- Star it if you find it useful  
- Fork & add features (batch upload, history, dark mode toggle, etc.)  
- Open issues if it breaks on your browser/device  
- Share the live link with friends who complain about big photos
